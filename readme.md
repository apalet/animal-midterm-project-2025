# Changes since the last assignment

1. add a new page and content About and Credits.

2. add some hyper links to github.

3. add a link in <head> for the kit of icons from fontawesome. One for Home nav, another ones for decorations and support accessibility.

4. fixed and remade the menu nav at the top of the page. add box shadow.

5. add hovers to some classes .atop, .abottom, and to the a elements. Change the color of the a elements to #510c0d

6. color Palette monochromatic type, was pretty helpful "coolors.co":
#FFFFFF - background
#FFF5F5 - background and fonts
#F08080 - "a" hovers
#841617 - nav background, fonts and h1/h2 first letters
#510c0d - "a" elements
#000000 - fonts                

7. replace new colors for old ones (no much different but help to standardized the new palette)


Things i wish to fix if i have more time:

- the sound bar goes over the fixed nav bat at the top
- depend less on margins and paddings, maybe using some display: box, flex-box, grid.
