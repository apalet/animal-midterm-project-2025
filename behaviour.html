                <p>
                    Red-crowned cranes have a highly varied diet, eating both plants and animals. 
                    They consume rice, seeds, berries, aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, insects, crustaceans, 
                    small reptiles, birds, and rodents. 
                    An adult requires about <strong>750 g (26oz) of food per day</strong> .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although omnivorous, they show a <em>preference for animal matter</em>, unlike other more 
                    herbivorous crane species. In Japan, <strong>rice is vital for winter survival</strong>, 
                    while elsewhere they feed on small fish, insects, crabs, and protein-rich plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They forage by keeping their heads close to the ground or probing mud with their beaks.
                    Fish are caught with rapid neck strikes, and larger prey is torn apart by shaking. 
                    Most foraging occurs in <em>wetlands, fields, shallow rivers, and lake shores</em>.

                Red-crowned cranes show varied social behavior, foraging alone, in pairs, or family groups, 
                but roosting in larger flocks of up to 80. By spring, pairs stay together while juveniles 
                and nonbreeders disperse. Even outside nesting, <strong>they are territorial</strong>, 
                keeping 2 to 3 meters apart and sometimes attacking intruders.

                <p>
                    The red-crowned crane is <strong>monogamous, long-lived, and believed to mate for life</strong>, 
                    reaching breeding maturity at 3 or 4 years. Courtship and reproduction occur mainly 
                    in April and early May. Pair bonding is reinforced through duets, which serve 
                    multiple purposes: strengthening bonds, advertising territory, signaling aggression, 
                    and defending resources. Duets involve rhythmic movements and synchronized calls, 
                    often sparking other pairs to join in. Dancing, which occurs year-round, is complex 
                    in meaning but generally reflects excitement and social interaction.

                <p>
                    During the breeding season, red-crowned crane pairs defend territories of 1 to 7 km<sup></sup>, 
                    often reusing the same sites each year. Nests are usually placed in wetlands with 
                    tall grasses, on wet ground or shallow water, and sometimes even on frozen surfaces. 
                    Females choose the site, but both sexes build the nest, a process that takes about a week. 
                    <strong>Most nests contain two eggs</strong>, though clutches of one to three have been observed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Both parents incubate the eggs for about 30 days</strong> and feed the chicks, which fledge at around 95 
                    days and stay with their parents for about 9 months. Hatchlings are small, yellow, and gradually 
                    learn to forage and fly before migration. Red-crowned cranes are <strong>long-lived birds, averaging 30 
                    to 40 years</strong>, with some reaching 75 in captivity.

                <p>
                    Red-crowned cranes have <strong>no natural predators</strong> on their wintering grounds due to their large size, 
                    standing about 1.5 m tall. They tolerate small raptors near their nests but aggressively repel potential 
                    egg or chick predators, including certain birds of prey and mammals like foxes, weasels, and badgers. 
                    Even larger canids can be driven off by protective adult cranes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasional nest losses occur, with introduced American minks being notably successful predators of eggs 
                    and chicks. Rarely, subadult or adult cranes may be killed by red foxes or leopard cats, but adults can 
                    usually escape or defend themselves with their strong beaks.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Smaller white-naped cranes may nest nearby, but competition is limited due to dietary differences, 
                    and <strong>red-crowned cranes dominate when conflicts arise</strong>. They are also <strong>highly defensive 
                    toward humans</strong>, capable of causing injury with their beaks and feet if approached.
